A simple plugin that creates an easy to use Thanksgiving countdown for your WordPress sites.

== Description ==

= Basic Instructions =

This plugin works out-of-the-box, so once the plugin is installed, you can place a shortcode wherever you want.

Use the shortcode **`[pcf_tg_countdown]`** to output the countdown.

The countdown will output in days by default (e.g '105 days until Thanksgiving!').


= Changing output type =

The shortcode can be given a 'type' attribute, like so:

    [pcf_tg_countdown type="days|weeks|sleeps"]
    
This enables you to change the output type.

There are 3 types to choose from:

* Days
* Weeks
* Sleeps

If you do not specify the type attribute, or specify an invalid type, it will default to 'days'.

Example:

    [pcf_tg_countdown type="weeks"]

will output as

    It's `x` weeks and `y` days until Thanksgiving!


= Styling the output =

*Styling the output is an advanced setting, that involves writing custom CSS.*

The shortcode can be given an 'id' attribute, which can then be used to style the output using CSS.

For example,

    [pcf_tg_countdown id="my-id"]

would output in HTML as

    <p id="my-id">...</p>

You can then add custom CSS through **`Appearance > Editor`**. If your theme supports custom CSS, you may be able to add your styles in Theme Options. If there is a custom css file in Editor, it is advised to use that for custom styles.

Here is an example of some custom styles:

    #my-id{
        color: red;
        font-size: 16px;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }

This will set the output to be red, underlined, and to have a font size of 16px.


== Installation ==

1. Upload 'thanksgiving-countdown.zip' to WordPress
2. Activate the plugin once installed.
3. Place shortcode where you want the countdown to appear!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I style the outputted text? =

Yes! You can add an ID using the id `id` attribute. See 'Description' for more information.

= Can I change the output text? =

Other than the built in `type` attributes, no. However, with the premium version of our plugin you can custom this text.
